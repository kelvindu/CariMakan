# CariMakan
A simple food searching and navigation app for Indonesia Android Kejar batch 3 final project.

This is a simple restaurant browsing and navigation app. built using this awesome api:
https://developers.zomato.com/api

I actually want to provide data such as menu photos, restaurant photos, and the opening hours.
but it seems they didn't permit you to use that data so yeah beggars can't be choosers.

By all means please clone the app or fork it however you wish and make this project more awesome!
